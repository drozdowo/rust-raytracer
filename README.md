rust implementation of c++ book https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

# What?
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html is a book about creating a simple raytracer in c++ in a few days.

# Why ?
As Rust is similarly a low-level language, I figured implementing this raytracing tutorial in Rust would be a great way to get up-to-speed with the language,
and have a cool project.
